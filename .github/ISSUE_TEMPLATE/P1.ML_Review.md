  - [x] Section 0: Install Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook

- [x  Section 1: Regression
  - [x] Do coding for Linear Regression using sklearn
  - [x] Answer this: How Linear Regression learns?
     `[first we have some training set then it finds a line that it makes the loss function minimum and because the degree is 2 it is easy to find the minimum]`
  
- [x] Section 2: Classification
  - [x] KNN
    - [x] KNN classification
    - [x] Answer this: what is the main idea of KNN?
       `[KNN stands for K nearest neighbours so we assign the class of a sample to class that is most appeared in k nearest neibours of that sample]`
    - [x] Answer this: is KNN good for large data? why?
       `[No it is not because indeed we are working with dimentions of our datas and if the number of datas grow the dimentions will be more and it will be hard to compute the algorithm and it will not be very smooth to classify because maybe the same points can be far from each other ]`
  - [x] Naive Bayes
    - [x] How to factorize the likelihood probability?
    - [x] Why can we ignore the prior probability?
    - [x] Answer this: what is the main idea of Naive Bayes?
     `[The main idea is to use voting and bayes rule and compute it as simple as possible that we assume the features are independent]`
  - [x] Decision Tree
    - [x] DT classification
    - [x] Answer this: Compare KNN and Naive Bayes
       `[Some important diffrences are that we should train our data in Naive Bayse but we shouldnt in knn or Naive Bayes is a linear classifier but knn is not so in large data sets the complexity computation of knn is huge and Naive Bayes beats knn in large data sets]`
  
- [x] Section 3: Clustering
  - [x] KMeans
    - [x] EDA
    - [x] Train model
    - [x] Answer this: what is the main idea of KMeans?
     `[The main idea to cluster the datas into groups is to find the centroid of each cluster and we have a gradualy algorithm for that to find the centroids]`
    - [x] Answer this: what is the similarity and difference of KMeans and KNN?
    `[First of all Kmeans is an unsupervised learning algorithm because we dont know the lable or cluster of each data but in KNN we know
    Then we should consider that we use KNN for classification and regression but we use KMeans for clustering,
    in Kmeans it creates the clusters but in KNN there exist the clusters and for the new datas we use KNN to classify them,
    KNN is much more lazy than KMeans algorithm,
    K-NN performs much better if all of the data have the same scale but this is not true for K-means
    for similarity we can say in both we use geomettric distance in their algorithms]`
  - [x] PCA
    - [x] Train model
    - [x] Answer this: what is the PCA main idea?
      `[The main idea of PCA is to find another span vector for a system that each principle vector(from n principle vectors) that the projection of data on to them make the most variances from the most to the least then we can choose k principle component from n and analyse them without losing considerable feature.]`
    - [x] Answer this: what is the similarity and difference of PCA and SVD decomposition algorithm?
      `[FILL HERE WITH RIGHT ANSWERS]`
  
- [x] Section 4: Ensemble Learning
  - [x] Boosting
  
  - [x] Bagging
  
  - [x] Answer this: what is the similarity and difference of Boosting and Bagging?
  
    `[FILL HERE WITH RIGHT ANSWERS]`
