  - [x] Section 0: Install Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook

- [ ] Section 1: Regression
  - [x] Do coding for Linear Regression using sklearn
  - [x] Answer this: How Linear Regression learns?
     `[first we have some training set then it finds a line that it makes the loss function minimum and because the degree is 2 it is easy to find the minimum]`
  
- [x] Section 2: Classification
  - [x] KNN
    - [x] KNN classification
    - [x] Answer this: what is the main idea of KNN?
       `[KNN stands for K nearest neighbours so we assign the class of a sample to class that is most appeared in k nearest neibours of that sample]`
    - [x] Answer this: is KNN good for large data? why?
       `[No it is not because indeed we are working with dimentions of our datas and if the number of datas grow the dimentions will be more and it will be hard to compute the algorithm and it will not be very smooth to classify because maybe the same points can be far from each other ]`
  - [x] Naive Bayes
    - [x] How to factorize the likelihood probability?
    - [x] Why can we ignore the prior probability?
    - [x] Answer this: what is the main idea of Naive Bayes?
     `[The main idea is to use voting and bayes rule and compute it as simple as possible that we assume the features are independent]`
  - [x] Decision Tree
    - [x] DT classification
    - [x] Answer this: Compare KNN and Naive Bayes
       `[Some important diffrences are that we should train our data in Naive Bayse but we shouldnt in knn or Naive Bayes is a linear classifier but knn is not so in large data sets the complexity computation of knn is huge and Naive Bayes beats knn in large data sets]`
  
- [x] Section 3: Clustering
  - [x] KMeans
    - [ ] EDA
    - [x] Train model
    - [x] Answer this: what is the main idea of KMeans?
     `[The main idea of kmean]`
    - [x] Answer this: what is the similarity and difference of KMeans and KNN?
    `[FILL HERE WITH RIGHT ANSWERS]`
  - [ ] PCA
    - [ ] Train model
    - [ ] Answer this: what is the PCA main idea?
      `[FILL HERE WITH RIGHT ANSWERS]`
    - [ ] Answer this: what is the similarity and difference of PCA and SVD decomposition algorithm?
      `[FILL HERE WITH RIGHT ANSWERS]`
  
- [ ] Section 4: Ensemble Learning
  - [ ] Boosting
  
  - [ ] Bagging
  
  - [ ] Answer this: what is the similarity and difference of Boosting and Bagging?
